abstract = "We develop an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that can recognize potential risks in traffic scenes and provide the reasoning for its prediction. In this study, we extend our previous risk prediction model combining logic-based reasoning with physics simulation, based on ontology-based traffic scene understanding research. Our evaluation on a real-life traffic incident database demonstrates the potentiality of our approach."
